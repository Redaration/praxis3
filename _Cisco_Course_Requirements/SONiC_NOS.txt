SONiC NOS Fundamentals
Class Size:
Who Should Attend
* Network Architects
* Solution Architects
* Network Engineers
* System Administrators
* Cloud Engineers
Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive overview of SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) Network Operating System, and the open-source tools necessary for implementing and managing modern network infrastructure. The goal of this course is to understand how SONiC works, its architecture, and how it can be deployed, configured, and administered in various network environments. This course will also include hands-on labs where you will configure and administer key SONiC features.
