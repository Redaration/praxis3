Each question should:
1. Be clearly related to the module content
2. Have exactly 4 possible answers (A, B, C, D)
3. Have only one correct answer
4. Test understanding, not just memorization

Provide your response in JSON format with this structure:
{
    "quiz": [
        {
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of X?",
            "options": ["A. Option 1", "B. Option 2", "C. Option 3", "D. Option 4"],
            "correct_answer": "B"
        },
        // more questions...
