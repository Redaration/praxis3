# Quiz for 5: Advanced Networking with SONiC

Question 1: What is the primary role of BGP in a network, according to the module content?
  A. To provide fast convergence for interior gateway routing.
  B. To exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems (AS) and within large internal networks.
  C. To manage multicast traffic forwarding using a shortest path tree.
  D. To establish and maintain VXLAN tunnels for Layer 2 extension.


Question 2: When configuring BGP in SONiC, which command is used to add a neighbor and specify its Autonomous System number?
  A. `config router bgp as <asn>`
  B. `config router bgp neighbor <neighbor_ip> remote-as <asn>`
  C. `config router bgp neighbor <neighbor_ip> update-source <interface>`
  D. `show ip bgp summary`


Question 3: Which routing protocol is described as a link-state protocol suitable for interior gateway functions, known for its hierarchical design with areas?
  A. BGP
  B. RIPv2
  C. OSPF
  D. EIGRP


Question 4: To advertise a specific network into an OSPF routing domain in SONiC, which command would you use?
  A. `config router ospf router-id <id>`
  B. `config router ospf area <area_id> network <network>/<prefix>`
  C. `show ip ospf neighbor`
  D. `config router ospf enable`


Question 5: In SONiC, what is required before dynamic routing protocols like BGP or OSPF can be properly configured and operational?
  A. Enabling the EVPN address family in BGP.
  B. Ensuring the FRR service is enabled and interfaces have IP addresses.
  C. Configuring VXLAN tunnel endpoints.
  D. Applying QoS policies to all interfaces.


Question 6: EVPN-VXLAN utilizes BGP primarily for which purpose in its control plane?
  A. To negotiate VXLAN tunnel parameters like UDP port.
  B. To distribute MAC address and IP reachability information.
  C. To manage Quality of Service policies across the overlay.
  D. To implement Access Control Lists for traffic filtering.


Question 7: Which SONiC command is used to map a traditional VLAN to a VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI), integrating it into the EVPN-VXLAN overlay?
  A. `config vxlan interface <vxlan_id> <vni>`
  B. `config vlan <vlan_id> vxlan <vni>`
  C. `config vxlan add <vxlan_id> <vni>`
  D. `config router bgp activate <neighbor_ip> evpn`


Question 8: When dealing with Quality of Service (QoS), which of the following is a fundamental concept related to managing network traffic during congestion periods?
  A. ACL rule application
  B. Dynamic routing protocol selection
  C. Queuing and Scheduling
  D. MAC address learning


Question 9: Which command is used in SONiC to view statistics related to configured QoS queues?
  A. `show qos policy`
  B. `show running-config`
  C. `show qos queue`
  D. `show acl table`


Question 10: Access Control Lists (ACLs) are primarily used for what purpose in network management?
  A. To prioritize specific types of traffic over others.
  B. To extend Layer 2 segments across a Layer 3 network.
  C. To filter network traffic based on predefined rules and criteria.
  D. To establish peering sessions between different Autonomous Systems.
