# Quiz for 8: Troubleshooting SONiC

Question 1: Which command is most useful for quickly identifying if a network interface is operational or degraded?
  A. `show ip route`
  B. `show interfaces status`
  C. `show system resources`
  D. `arp -an`


Question 2: When troubleshooting routing issues on a SONiC device, what command would you use to check the state of your OSPF neighbors?
  A. `show ip bgp summary`
  B. `show route all`
  C. `show ip ospf neighbor`
  D. `ping`


Question 3: You are experiencing slow network performance. Which of these commands would be most relevant to check for excessive traffic errors or dropped packets on an interface?
  A. `ip link show`
  B. `show interfaces counters`
  C. `traceroute`
  D. `docker ps`


Question 4: To understand the CPU and memory utilization on your SONiC switch, which command would you use?
  A. `show system info`
  B. `show interfaces status`
  C. `show system resources`
  D. `tcpdump`


Question 5: When analyzing logs for a specific issue, like an interface going down, what is a key action to take?
  A. Only look for the keyword 'down' in logs.
  B. Immediately restart the switch.
  C. Check logs related to SAI/SWSS and interface events.
  D. Increase the system's log retention period.


Question 6: A systematic troubleshooting approach for network issues typically starts with:
  A. Analyzing advanced packet captures.
  B. Restarting all network services.
  C. Defining the problem clearly and isolating its scope.
  D. Immediately changing the BGP configuration.


Question 7: Which tool is primarily used for capturing network packets directly on a SONiC device for later analysis?
  A. Wireshark
  B. `ethtool`
  C. `tcpdump`
  D. `traceroute`


Question 8: When examining a packet capture file (`.pcap`) using Wireshark, what aspect of the traffic is essential to analyze to understand network performance problems?
  A. The capture file's creation timestamp.
  B. The protocol version used by the sender.
  C. Packet retransmissions, errors, and latency.
  D. The MAC address of the capture device.


Question 9: To debug issues at the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) in SONiC, which CLI tool would be most relevant?
  A. `swss-cli`
  B. `docker logs`
  C. `sai-cli`
  D. `show interfaces counters`


Question 10: A layered troubleshooting approach suggests starting an investigation from which OSI layer?
  A. Layer 7 (Application)
  B. Layer 1 (Physical)
  C. Layer 3 (Network)
  D. Layer 4 (Transport)
