# Quiz for 1: What is SONiC NOS

Question 1: What is SONiC fundamentally described as?
  A. A proprietary network operating system for specialized hardware.
  B. An open-source network operating system for cloud networking.
  C. A hardware-agnostic firmware for network virtualization.
  D. A management platform for legacy network devices.


Question 2: A key goal of SONiC is to address vendor lock-in. How does it primarily achieve this?
  A. By enforcing strict hardware compatibility lists.
  B. By offering a closed-source, highly optimized solution.
  C. By supporting a wide range of hardware and enabling network disaggregation.
  D. By providing extensive managed services and support contracts.


Question 3: The concept of 'network disaggregation' in SONiC refers to:
  A. Breaking down large networks into smaller, isolated segments.
  B. Separating network hardware from the network operating system software.
  C. The process of decommissioning old network equipment.
  D. Encrypting network traffic to prevent unauthorized access.


Question 4: Which characteristic of SONiC allows for quicker implementation of new features and bug resolutions?
  A. Its reliance on legacy protocols.
  B. Its proprietary and closed-source nature.
  C. Its foundation in open-source development and community collaboration.
  D. Its limited support for hardware customization.


Question 5: SONiC was developed to meet specific demands of which environment?
  A. Small office/home office (SOHO) networks.
  B. Enterprise campus networks.
  C. Cloud-scale data centers.
  D. Industrial automation networks.


Question 6: Why is SONiC considered beneficial for reducing capital expenditure?
  A. It requires expensive, specialized hardware.
  B. It eliminates the need for network hardware altogether.
  C. It allows for the selection of cost-effective, best-of-breed hardware components.
  D. It mandates the purchase of bundled hardware and software from a single vendor.


Question 7: The open-source nature of SONiC contributes to:
  A. Increased licensing costs and restricted access to source code.
  B. Transparency, rapid bug fixes, and a larger pool of developers.
  C. A slower pace of innovation due to a lack of centralized control.
  D. Dependence on a single vendor for all updates and support.


Question 8: What benefit does SONiC offer regarding hardware flexibility?
  A. It limits compatibility to a very narrow range of hardware.
  B. It strictly adheres to proprietary hardware designs.
  C. It allows users to choose and combine different hardware vendors.
  D. It requires a specific ASIC from a single manufacturer.


Question 9: Which of the following is a primary goal of SONiC related to development cycles?
  A. To prolong the lifecycle of existing hardware.
  B. To enable faster innovation cycles.
  C. To standardize on a single hardware platform.
  D. To reduce the complexity of network management through manual processes.


Question 10: SONiC's design for 'cloud scale' emphasizes:
  A. Limited routing table support and low bandwidth.
  B. High performance, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.
  C. Manual configuration and a resistance to automation.
  D. Robustness primarily in small, isolated network environments.
