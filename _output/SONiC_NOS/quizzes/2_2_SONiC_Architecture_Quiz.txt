# Quiz for 2: SONiC Architecture

Question 1: What is the primary role of the SONiC System Services (SWSS)?
  A. Translating software state to hardware instructions.
  B. Centralizing network state management and communicating with other services.
  C. Providing a standardized API for network silicon.
  D. Storing the desired network configuration in a Redis database.


Question 2: The Synchronizer Daemon (Syncd) is responsible for:
  A. Managing routing protocols using the FRR daemon.
  B. Acting as the central orchestrator for network state.
  C. Ensuring consistency between software state and hardware by interacting with the ASIC Programming Interface (SAI).
  D. Providing telemetry data through gNMI.


Question 3: Which component provides a vendor-neutral interface that abstracts ASIC-specific details, enabling SONiC to run on diverse hardware?
  A. SONiC System Services (SWSS)
  B. Synchronizer Daemon (Syncd)
  C. SONiC Abstraction Interface (SAI)
  D. Configuration Database (Config DB)


Question 4: The Configuration Database (Config DB) serves as:
  A. The primary interface for the ASIC Programming Interface (SAI).
  B. A repository for hardware telemetry data.
  C. The centralized storage for the desired network configuration, written in Redis.
  D. The service responsible for handling routing protocols.


Question 5: What is a key benefit of SONiC's microservices-based architecture?
  A. All network functions are tightly integrated into a single monolithic process.
  B. It simplifies hardware vendor integration by having a single, complex service.
  C. Modularity and fault isolation, allowing for easier updates and improved resilience.
  D. It relies exclusively on direct hardware manipulation without any abstraction layers.


Question 6: How does containerization (Docker) benefit the SONiC architecture?
  A. It eliminates the need for any abstraction layers like SAI.
  B. It promotes a monolithic design for better performance.
  C. It provides isolation and portability for services, simplifying deployment and ensuring a consistent environment.
  D. It's primarily used for managing the Config DB.


Question 7: In the SONiC data flow, after a configuration change is written to the Config DB, which component first processes these changes?
  A. Synchronizer Daemon (Syncd)
  B. SONiC Abstraction Interface (SAI)
  C. SONiC System Services (SWSS)
  D. FRR (Free Range Routing)


Question 8: Which statement best describes the interaction between SWSS and Syncd during a configuration update?
  A. Syncd directly reads the Config DB and instructs SWSS.
  B. SWSS generates SAI commands based on Config DB changes and sends them to Syncd for hardware programming.
  C. SWSS interacts with SAI directly, bypassing Syncd.
  D. Syncd translates SAI commands into Config DB entries.


Question 9: What is the primary purpose of the SONiC Abstraction Interface (SAI)?
  A. To manage the lifecycle of Docker containers.
  B. To provide a standardized API for interacting with network silicon, abstracting vendor-specific details.
  C. To facilitate inter-service communication through message queues.
  D. To store and manage telemetry data.


Question 10: How does SONiC handle state notifications from the hardware?
  A. Hardware events are ignored to maintain configuration stability.
  B. Syncd relays hardware state changes to SWSS, which then updates its state and potentially notifies other services.
  C. SWSS directly polls the hardware for state changes.
  D. Notifications are only sent to the Config DB.
