# Quiz for 6: SONiC Management and Monitoring

Question 1: What is the primary role of the SONiC Configuration Database (Config DB)?
  A. To store real-time operational status of network interfaces.
  B. To maintain the desired state of the network configuration.
  C. To log all network events and system messages.
  D. To manage user authentication and authorization.


Question 2: When you make a configuration change using the SONiC CLI, where is that change initially applied?
  A. Directly to the running configuration of each microservice.
  B. To the Config DB, which is then reconciled with the hardware.
  C. To a temporary log file before commit.
  D. Only to configuration backups for auditing purposes.


Question 3: Which command is used to export the current SONiC configuration to a file?
  A. `sudo config export filename.json`
  B. `sudo sonic-backup save filename.json`
  C. `sudo consul export filename.json`
  D. `sudo config save filename.json`


Question 4: What is the purpose of the SWSS (Switch State Service) in SONiC?
  A. To provide a web-based GUI for configuration.
  B. To reconcile the Config DB with the actual hardware state.
  C. To aggregate logs from all microservices.
  D. To manage SNMP traps and alerts.


Question 5: If you want to view the logs of a specific SONiC microservice (container) in real-time, which CLI command would be most appropriate?
  A. `show log --tail`
  B. `show log <service_name>`
  C. `tail -f /var/log/syslog`
  D. `show log filename.log`


Question 6: When configuring remote syslog, which syntax is used to send logs via UDP to a syslog server?
  A. `*.* @@<syslog_server_ip>:<port>`
  B. `*.* @<syslog_server_ip>:<port>`
  C. `syslog.* @<syslog_server_ip>:<port>`
  D. `*.* UDP:<syslog_server_ip>:<port>`


Question 7: What is gNMI primarily utilized for in SONiC?
  A. Collecting NetFlow and sFlow data for traffic analysis.
  B. Managing SNMP community strings and user credentials.
  C. Streaming telemetry and configuration management using gRPC.
  D. Performing software upgrades and downgrades.


Question 8: Before performing a SONiC software upgrade, what is a crucial pre-upgrade check?
  A. Disabling all logging services.
  B. Checking release notes for compatibility and known issues.
  C. Deleting all existing configuration backups.
  D. Rebooting the device to clear memory.


Question 9: Which command is used to initiate a SONiC software upgrade?
  A. `sudo sonic-upgrade install <image_path>`
  B. `sudo sonic-installer upgrade <image_path>`

  D. `sudo boot-manager load <image_path>`


Question 10: To revert to a previous stable version of SONiC if an upgrade causes issues, you would typically use:
