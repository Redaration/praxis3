  B. Small random reads/writes for checkpoints, logs
  C. High ingest rates during data collection
  D. Concurrent access from many compute nodes


Question 2: For AI workloads, which storage technology offers the highest IOPS and lowest latency, making it ideal for active datasets, but is also the most costly for large capacities?
  A. HDDs (Hard Disk Drives)
  B. SAS/SATA SSDs
  C. NVMe SSDs
  D. Object Storage


Question 3: What is the primary benefit of using Parallel File Systems like Lustre or GPFS in AI/ML environments?
  A. Lowest cost per terabyte for large archival data
  B. High-speed, concurrent access for many compute nodes
  C. Simple deployment and management for small datasets
  D. Best suited for single-user, interactive workloads


Question 4: When considering data lifecycle management for AI, what is the purpose of data versioning and provenance?
  A. To automatically delete old datasets to save space
  B. To compress data for faster transfer
  C. To track changes and ensure reproducibility of models
  D. To secure data in transit using encryption


Question 5: Which file system mount option is most likely to reduce metadata operations and improve read performance on large, frequently accessed datasets?
  A. `sync` write
  B. `noatime`
  C. `hard` mount
  D. `directio`


Question 6: In the context of Kubernetes, what is the role of CSI (Container Storage Interface) drivers regarding storage for AI workloads?
  A. To manage user roles and permissions within pods
  B. To dynamically provision and manage storage for containers
  C. To optimize network throughput for storage access
  D. To perform data deduplication and compression automatically

  A. Increase data retrieval speeds
  B. Reduce the overall storage footprint
  C. Enhance data security through obscurity
  D. Improve application performance by reducing latency


Question 9: For compliance reasons related to data privacy (like GDPR or HIPAA), what is a critical aspect of data lifecycle management?
  A. Utilizing the fastest available storage tier
  B. Implementing strict data deletion and retention policies
  C. Maximizing data ingest rates
  D. Enabling maximum concurrent access from all nodes


Question 10: When mounting distributed file systems for AI compute nodes, setting the `rsize` and `wsize` mount options primarily affects:
  A. The security of data in transit
  B. The block size for read and write operations
  C. The method of data versioning
  D. The availability of object storage
