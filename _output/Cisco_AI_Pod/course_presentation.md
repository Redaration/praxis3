- Check Kubelet status on the node
- Verify network connectivity to the control plane
- Check resource exhaustion (CPU, memory)
- Inspecting system logs on the node
- Ensuring container runtime is running
- Checking DNS resolution

#### Pod Scheduling Failures

- Insufficient resources (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Node affinity/anti-affinity constraints
- Taints and tolerations mismatch
- Pod scheduling policies
- Checking scheduler logs
- Node selectors and labels

#### Application Crashes

- Reviewing application logs for errors
- Checking resource limits and requests
- Verifying dependencies and configurations
- Investigating segmentation faults or memory leaks
- Checking container image integrity
- External service dependencies

#### Network Performance Degradation

- Monitoring bandwidth and latency
- Identifying packet loss
- Verifying RoCE configuration (PFC, ECN)
- Checking network fabric congestion
- Examining network policies
- Troubleshooting MTU mismatches

#### Storage Performance Issues

- Monitoring storage IOPS and throughput
- Checking disk space
- Verifying file system mount options
- Investigating storage network connectivity
- Analyzing I/O patterns
- Performance tuning of storage backend

#### GPU Resource Issues

- Verifying GPU drivers and CUDA installation
- Checking GPU allocation in Pods
- Monitoring GPU utilization and memory
- Diagnosing MIG configuration errors
- Ensuring GPUDirect RDMA is functional
- Checking for GPU overheating or hardware failures

### General Troubleshooting Best Practices

#### Understand the Problem Scope

- Isolate the issue to a specific component or layer
- Determine if it's reproducible
- Check for recent changes or updates
- Define the symptoms clearly
- Gather relevant logs and metrics
- Formulate a hypothesis

#### Systematic Approach

- Start with the most likely causes
- Check connectivity first
- Verify configurations
- Isolate variables
- Test solutions incrementally
- Document findings and changes

#### Leverage Monitoring and Logging

- Use dashboards to identify anomalies
- Analyze logs for error messages
- Correlate metrics with events
- Set up proactive alerts
- Leverage historical data
- Utilize specialized diagnostic tools

#### Collaboration and Documentation

- Consult documentation and support resources
- Engage with team members or support engineers
- Maintain a knowledge base
- Document troubleshooting steps and solutions
- Share lessons learned
- Post-mortem analysis for critical incidents

#### Proactive Maintenance

- Keep software and firmware up to date
- Regularly review system health
- Perform capacity planning
- Test backup and restore procedures
- Monitor resource utilization trends
- Conduct regular security audits
